## Understanding the layout
The layout was created around making the layout as easy as possible to memorise.
As many keys as possible were replaced by their Latin equivalent.
#### Examples:
  `г` is mapped to `h`
  `ф` is mapped to `f`
  `п` is mapped to `p`
This has been done for ease of use.

### Dead Keys
Dead keys are keys that alter the next keypress, without (necessarily) being a keypress themselves.
In this case, the only dead key is `й`.
#### Instances:
  `й` then `а` enters `я`
  `й` then `е` enters `є`
  `й` then `і` enters `ї`
  `й` then `о` enters `ё`
  `й` then `у` enters `ю`
In order to type `й` itself, you can just type `й` followed by any other letter.
#### TO BYPASS DEAD KEYS, YOU MUST USE THE ALTGR LAYER TO TYPE `Й`.

### AltGr Layer
AltGr is used as a modifier for the keys.
#### Instances:
  `г` becomes `ґ`
  `ц` becomes `ч`
  `з` becomes `ж`
  `ь` becomes `ъ`
  `ш` becomes `щ`
